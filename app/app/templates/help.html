                <li>This app is designed to make it as easy as possible to
                    enter what you worked on during the day.</li>

                <li><b>If a PI or project doesn't exist,</b>
                    this is probably because a project has been created
                    recently but the config for this app has not been
                    updated.</li>

                <li><b>If you worked on multiple projects </b>in a day create entries
                    for each of them.  Note that the total fraction for the day
                    cannot exceed 1.0.</li>

                <li><b>A day does not need to sum to 1.0.</b> Sometimes you're
                    working on things that don't need to be tracked.
